Sprint 1
meeting 4 - Scrum Master: Evan
As a group we planned how we were going to merge our changes.
we had 3 different merges because of group members not pulling the code and then pushing it.
However, we fixed this during the meeting by changing branches so we could all pull a working version of the code.
From there we only had one week left of sprint one but most tasks were done but were not pushed due to merging issues.
Overall, we should meet our deadline for sprint 1 since this major issue has been fixed.


Sprint 2
Metting 1 - Scrum Master: Francis
We decided what additional features we would be implementing on our system and divided the tasks up.

Progress bar, Bug fixes - Evan, Tharun
Friends system & Friend leaderboard - Francis
Admin Analytics -  Trevor, Rohaan
Course reviews - Ruwanmi
Quiz system - Abdullahai
trending courses - Akash

Primary focus on week one will be bug fixes.

Meeting 2 - Scrum Master: Trevor
We got together and shared our progress since the previous meeting.
Majority of the features are almost done however, we discussed encountered bugs with the database, trending courses and admin analytics.
Admin analytics bug was fixed with code refactoring and how to improve admin page UI was discussed.
Also decided to refactor the courses page from sprint 1 to implement progress bar.
Overall, sprint is progressing in a timely manner and features are scheduled to be completed by the end of the week for system testing.
